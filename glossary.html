 <ul>
     <li>Can be up to 5 feet long and weigh up to 16 pounds. Typically, eels are around 2 to 3 feet in length</li>
    <li>The color of eels varies based on their habitat. They can change colors to match the surface around them. Typically, eels are a dark brown with faded yellow on the sides. Their belly can be pale brown, yellow or white.
    </li>
    <li>Prey on ultimately any small fish or invertebrate that crosses its path
    </li>
    <li>Fun Fact: They arrive to our coast with their sex undetermined and years later swim offshore for over a thousand miles to spawn once and die.

  </li>
  <li>Predators of the Atlantic bonito are larger fish like tuna, marlin and wahoo. Atlantic bonito are a pelagic species, meaning they live in the middle of the sea in the open water. They are not found on the bottom of the ocean or near the top. Sometimes, they will come close to shore and enter estuaries.</li>
